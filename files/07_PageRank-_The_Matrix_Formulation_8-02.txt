So, in order to come up with
a different mathematical formulation of
this basic idea of modelling the flow,
we will first define what we will call
our stochastic adjacency matrix M.
And then we will express everything
in terms of linear algebra.
In terms of basically the ranks and this
matrix M as vector matrix multiplications.
And we will later why this
is good because we will be
able to start using the linear algebra
tools to implicitly solve the system of
equations that I showed
on the previous slide.
So here is how we proceed.
Our goal is to define
the stochastic matrix M,
that will basically be
an adjacency matrix.
Which basically means,
we want to take the graph and
represent it as a big matrix of values.
And the idea is that if a page
i points to page j then
we will have a non-zero entry in the cell
ji, and if there is, if the page,
page j does not point point to page i
then we, we will have a 0 entry there.
So now the question is what is
the value of the non-zero entry in,
in the cell of the matrix.
So the idea is if i points to j
then the corresponding entry ji in
the matrix M will be o over the f the out
degree of the, of the source node.
So out degree of node i.
Here you will already seen what
kind of where we are going right?
Before we said that whatever
is the importance of a node,
this importance gets evenly split
along all of its out-links.
So this means that, that the,
all the out-links of node i,
will have the weight 1 over di.
So this means that our matrix
is called column stochastic.
This means that every column,
every column in our matrix, sums to 1.
Okay, so now that we have the whole
graph represented as a matrix you
can also take all the page rank scores
of nodes and represent that as a vector.
Okay.
So the way we do this is that we
think that we have one entry in
our vector per page, we can think
that our pages are numbered 1,
2, 3, 4, 5 up to N so
we have a vector length N.
And every entry in this vector
basically corresponds to
the page rank score of a given,
of a given page.
Okay?
So that is all good and the other thing we
know from before is that the sum of
the entries of our vector equals to 1.
That was the constraint of
the flow equations we had,
we had on the previous slide.
So now what is interesting is that
we can take our flow equations,
kind of our basic equation.
And write it as a in terms of
the matrix M and the vector r.
So we can write it as rank vector r equals
the matrix M times the vector r again.
So now we basically have a big
system of equations, right?
M is fixed and we want to figure
out what are the values of r.
So just to convince you or demonstrate
why, why, why we can take our initial fl,
flow equations and express them
into this vector matrix product.
This may not be obvious, so here is how,
how we can understand that what we
are doing is actually true and correct.
So the idea is the following, right?
Imagine that I have my matrix M here
at the bottom, and I have my vector r.
And now I am multiplying M times r.
And just for the sake of the example,
let's assume that page I has the,
has the degree,
out degree of i equals 3, and
it also points, which means it points
to three other pages, including j.
This means that for a page i,
the col, the i-th column of matrix M
will have three non-zero elements.
Here are indicated by squares,
and each of these,
each of these three non-zero cells
will have a value of one-third right?
1 over the out degree of node i.
So now imagine what happens
when I take the j throw and
multiply it with the vector r.
When I'm,
when I'm scanning across the row here and
I'm scanning down the vector,
the vector, the vector r.
I'm basically computing the page
rank score of node j, right?
The page rank score of the node j is the
sum of the importances that are stored in
r, times the out degree of
that node that points to j.
So this way basically we take
this initial equation that we,
that we had before and
we express it as a vector matrix product.
So now we basically took our flow
formulation of the problem and expressed
it as this recursive, in a sense,
matrix equation of r equals M times r.
Now, what we observe is that this
looks very much like an kind of
Eigenvalue or problem.
So let me just remind you
what are Eigenvalues and
eigenvectors of a given matrix.
Right?
So if I have a matrix A then x
is called an eigenvector with
the corresponding eigenvalue lambda.
If x is a solution to the equation,
A times x equals lambda x.
Okay?
So, just saying it again.
A is a matrix that we, that we are given.
X is something that we'd like
to compute and it's a vector.
And lambda is also something that we'd
like to compute, and is a scalar.
Is a, is a real number,
or a complex number.
So, the point being is
that x is an eigenvector,
y is a eigenvalue, if they are solution
to this equation Ax equals lambda x.
So in,
in our equation looks very much similar.
Like, at least have M times r which
is the same as kind of A times x.
And then we say equals r, and
before we had equals lambda x.
So what this means,
is that a rank vector is an eigenvector
of the stochastic web matrix M.
And another important fact is that
it is a principal eigenvector.
Which means that it corresponds
to the eigenvalue with value 1.
Right, so, here I can see that
I implicitly multiply by 1 and
my lambda is 1.
Right?
In fact the large,
largest eigenvalue of M is once, is,
is 1 exactly because M
is column stochastic.
Why is that the case?
That's the case because
vector r has a unit length.
Meaning its coordinate sum are non, are
non, are non-negative and they sum to 1.
And each column of M also sums to 1.
So M times r will be the, the value
of that product, of that dot product,
will be at most at most 1.
So this means that the that
the corresponding eigenvalue the largest
eigenvalue of our matrix is 1, okay.
So why did, why did we do now.
So far we took our graph represented
it represented it as this big matrix,
and we reformulated our flow equations
into this matrix formulation and
now we establish the connection
between the matrix formulation and
the eigenvalues and
eigenvectors of matrix M.
So, what, what this now means
is basically instead of
thinking of this as solving a system
of equations, we can think of,
of our problem as finding
the eigenvector of, of matrix M.
And actually there is
a very efficient method for
finding eigenvectors of a given matrix.
And this method is called power iteration.
So now we actually know
how to compute page rank.
The way to compute page rank is to
find the, the eigenvector of matrix M
that corresponds to
the eigenvalue of value of 1.
So that's what we learn so far.
So now the,
we can actually go an compute the thing.
So let me show you what we have so far.
We have our little graph
web graph on three nodes.
We have our flow equations.
And we also now can write what
the structure of our matrix-m.
Here is the structure or our matrix-m.
Notice that the matrix is
really column stochastic.
So now, what we can, what,
how we can think of our flow equations,
we can think of them as this
vector matrix product, right?
So r, r equals M times r.
